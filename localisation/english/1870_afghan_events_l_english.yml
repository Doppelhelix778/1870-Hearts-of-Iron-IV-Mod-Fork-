 afghan_fpw.2.t:0 "How will we approuch the civil war?"
 afghan_fpw.2.d:0 "The Afghan Civil war has been going on for three years now. People in our country are starting to call for an immiediate victory. If we don't there might be unforseen consquences, but if we were to hold out and bide our time it would be much easier and less costly on out nation to do so. If you choose to attack now while we have less manpower and troops than the enemy it could end in failure, this is not recomended. If you take too long you will suffer severe consquences. Now choose how we handle the civil war."
