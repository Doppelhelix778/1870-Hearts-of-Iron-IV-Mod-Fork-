 fpw_CHI_widespread_corruption:0 "Widespread Corruption"
 fpw_CHI_widespread_corruption_desc:0 "Since the beginning of the century court officials have become much more complacent regarding China's position- denying reforms and choosing instead to fill their own pockets with whatever revenue the country gains, preventing it from achieving a position amongst the other Great Powers."
 fpw_CHI_ineffective_bannermen:0 "Ineffective Bannermen"
 fpw_CHI_ineffective_bannermen_desc:0 "The once glorious bannermen of the Great Qing have greatly declined in strength due to varying factors; corruption, lack of organisation as separate fighting forces, inadequate equipment quality and many more. Overall, this has left China in a very vulnerable and weak position on the world stage."
 fpw_CHI_century_of_humiliation:0 "Century of Humiliation"
 fpw_CHI_century_of_humiliation_desc:0 "Instability and incapability to defeat peasant rebels and foreign nations has shattered China's reputation as a Great Power, plunging it into the depths of it's so called 'Century of Humiliation'. With such a low image it appears to others that the Qing Dynasty has lost its Mandate of Heaven."
 fpw_CHI_disjointed_naval_vessels:0 "Disjoined Naval Vessels"
 fpw_CHI_disjointed_naval_vessels_desc:0 "The few modernised naval units owned by the Qing follow an appalling structure; each warship is owned by its region of creation, meaning warships created in Beiyang, Nanyang, Guangdong and Fujian all act independently in accordance to their province. This drastically weakens any chances at being a maritime power."
